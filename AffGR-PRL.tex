%% --------- Abstract
\begin{abstract}
  We show that general Einstein manifolds (with or without cosmological constant) are a possible solution to the equations of motion of a recently formulated affine model of gravity, when the connection is the one of Levi-Civita. Moreover, we find an equivalence between the minimally coupled massless scalar field in General Relativity with a ``minimally'' coupled scalar field in this affine model.

%%%%%%%%% THE MODEL %%%%%%%%%
In a previous paper~\cite{Skirzewski:2014eta}, we presented a purely affine gravitational model in four dimensions built up entirely on the basis of full diffeomorphism invariance, and restricting ourselves to consider only na\"ive power-counting renormalizable terms. We showed that its non-relativistic limit around a homogeneous and isotropic spacetime yields a Newtonian gravity. We also highlighted the possibility of using standard methods to quantize the model, due to its polynomial structure (unlike the earliest proposals~\cite{Eddington1923math,schrodinger1950space}), and also the likelihood of avoiding the uniqueness of diffeomorphism-invariant states from Loop Quantum Gravity programme~\cite{Lewandowski:2005jk}.

The four-dimensional action is written in terms of the curvature and torsion of an affine connection, $\Gamma^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}$, which accepts a decomposition on irreducible components as
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} = {\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} + T^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} = {\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma} + \epsilon_{\rho\sigma\lambda\kappa}T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}+A_{[\rho}\delta^\mu_{\nu]},
\end{equation}
where ${\Gamma}^\mu{}_{\rho\sigma}$ is symmetric in the lower indices, the $A_\mu$ is a vector field, the trace of torsion, and  $T^{\mu,\lambda\kappa}$ is a Curtright field~\cite{Curtright:1980yk}. Since no metric is present  the epsilon symbols are not related but instead we demand that \mbox{$\epsilon^{\delta\eta\lambda\kappa}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}=4!\delta^{\delta}{}_{[\mu}\delta^\eta{}_{\nu}\delta^{\lambda}{}_{\rho} \delta^\kappa{}_{\sigma]}$.}
\begin{widetext}
  Using the above decomposition, the most general (presumably renormalizable) action preserving diffeomorphisms is~\footnote{We have dropped the contribution to a boundary term, the complete action is written in Ref.~\cite{Skirzewski:2014eta}.}

  \end{dmath}
\end{widetext}
Although there is no obvious equivalence between the action in Eq.~\eqref{4dfull} and General Relativity (GR), particularly due to the lack of a source metric field, we analysed in Ref.~\cite{Skirzewski:2014eta} the scalar perturbations around a static homogeneous and isotropic background, and in the non-relativistic (low-momentum) limit, the geodesic deviation of inertial observed is also discussed.

Additionally, we included perturbative inhomogeneous sources to the connection field equations, by considering a generic matter action. Albeit the inclusion of matter in a non-metric spacetime is a nonstandard procedure, we used ``Eddington's metric density''%% \hl{JZ,AA: satisfy metric conditions? e.g. non-deg.}
defined as the variation of the action with respect to the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor~(see Refs.~\cite{Eddington1923math,schrodinger1950space,Poplawski:2012bw}), i.e.,%% \hl{JZ: def. $R_{(\mu\nu)}$}
\begin{equation}
  \label{metric}
  \frac{\delta\ }{\delta R_{(\mu\nu)}} S[\Gamma] \equiv \sqrt{\mathfrak{g}} \, \mathfrak{g}^{\mu\nu} = \bar{g}^{\mu\nu} ,
\end{equation}
by assuming a matter action that depends on $\bar{g}^{\mu\nu}$.

From the geodesic equations and the linearized action on scalar perturbation, we concluded that the effective potential
\begin{equation}
  \label{NewtonPot}
  v_L = \frac{1}{8\pi} \frac{ \partial\mathcal{L}_{\text{Matter}} }{ \partial \bar{g}^{00} } \frac{1}{|\vec{x}|},
\end{equation}
is the usual Newtonian potential for a massive source.

%%%%%%%%% COMPARISON GR %%%%%%%%%
Although we obtained the Newtonian gravitational potential~\eqref{NewtonPot}, the post-Newtonian approximation is necessary to explain gravitational phenomena like Mercury's perihelion and the deviation of light by a gravitational source. Therefore, we should go beyond the Newtonian limit in order to compare our model with GR.

%%\hl{A comparison between our affine model and GR requires the imposition of vanishing torsion (JZ: Why?).}
Even though a comparison between our affine model and GR does not require the imposition of vanishing torsion, at this stage we shall focus in a sector of the theory in which the connection is metric, and therefore its torsion vanishes. Interestingly, the field equations from Eq.~\eqref{4dfull} can be consistently ``truncated'' under such requirements, and the only nontrivial equation is the one for the Curtright, $T^{\lambda,\mu\nu}$,
\begin{equation*}
  \kappa_1 \nab{[\rho} R_{\mu]\lambda}{}^{\lambda}{}_{\nu} + \kappa_2 \nab{\nu} R_{\mu\rho}{}^\lambda{}_\lambda = 0.
\end{equation*}
In the considered sector the connection is compatible with a metric, therefore, the second term vanishes and the gravitational equations are
\begin{equation}
  \nab{[\rho} R_{\mu]\nu} = 0.
  \label{SimpleEOM}
\end{equation}

The above equation is a generalization of a condition known in Riemannian geometry as covariantly constant Ricci curvature --- aka parallel Ricci curvature ---, \mbox{$\nab{\rho} R_{\mu\nu} = 0$.} The parallel Ricci curvature is a generalization of the Einstein condition which assures that although the manifold is not generally Einstein, the metric has to be locally a product of Einstein metrics~\cite{Besse}.

Interestingly, a corollary is that all Einstein manifolds, \mbox{$R_{\mu\nu} \propto g_{\mu\nu}$,} satisfy the parallel Ricci condition, and therefore every vacuum solution to the Einstein's equations solves the (torsion-free) field equations of our model. Consequently, the fact that the non-relativistic limit of the gravitational potential in Eq.~\eqref{NewtonPot} yields a Newtonian potential seems clearer, and we can argue that even the post-Newtonian corrections coming from GR are present in the chosen scenario of our model.

Additionally, for a Riemannian manifold $(\Mi,g)$ the condition in Eq.~\eqref{SimpleEOM} is equivalent to the following statements (see Ref.~\cite{Besse}): (i) the Ricci tensor is a Codazzi tensor~\footnote{A Codazzi tensor is a symmetric $(0,2)$-type tensor, $T$, satisfying the condition \mbox{$D_X T(Y,Z) = D_Y T(X,Z)$.}}, (ii) the manifolds has harmonic curvature, and (iii) in the four-dimensional case the manifold $(\Mi,g)$ has harmonic Weyl tensor and constant scalar curvature.

%%%%%%%%% MATTER %%%%%%%%%
Until now, the most general diffeomorphism-invariant and power-counting renormalizable theory for an affine connection has been built. The theory does not require a spacetime metric, but instead we can find the Eddington's inverse metric density, $\bar{g}^{\mu\nu}$, arising as the functional variation of the action with respect to the symmetric part of the Ricci tensor. Following our precept, the matter content --- we consider just scalar matter --- should couple to $\bar{g}^{\mu\nu}$, which for Eq.~\eqref{4dfull} is
\begin{dmath}
  \bar{g}^{\mu\nu} = B_1\, \epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\rho\sigma} T^{\mu, \lambda\kappa} T^{\nu, \rho\sigma} + B_3\, A_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} + C_1\, \nabla_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda}.
\end{dmath}
Thus, we have considered the action provided by the ``kinetic term''
\begin{dmath}
  \label{ScalarAction}
  S_\phi = - \alpha \int \dn{4}{x} \Big( C_1\, \nabla_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda}  + B_3\, A_\lambda T^{\mu,\nu\lambda} + B_1\, \epsilon_{\lambda\kappa\rho\sigma} T^{\mu, \lambda\kappa} T^{\nu, \rho\sigma} \Big) \partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi,
\end{dmath}
which makes a nontrivial contribution to the field equations once the torsion is set to zero.

The equation for the Curtright field when the scalar field is turned on is
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla_{[\sigma} R_{\rho]\mu}{}^{\mu}{}_\nu - \frac{C_2}{C_1} \nabla_\nu  R_{\rho\sigma}{}^{\mu}{}_\mu - \alpha \nabla_{[\sigma} \Big( \partial_{\rho]}\phi \partial_\nu\phi \Big) = 0,
\end{equation*}
which simplifies to 
\begin{equation}
  \nabla_{[\sigma} R_{\rho]\nu} - \alpha \nabla_{[\sigma} \Big( \partial_{\rho]}\phi \partial_\nu\phi \Big) = 0,
  \label{SimpleEOMwS}
\end{equation}
when the connection is the Levi-Civita one. In that case, we find a particular solution of Eq.~\eqref{SimpleEOMwS}, \hl{JZ: What if non-LC connection?}
\begin{equation*}
  R_{\mu\nu} - \alpha \pa{\mu} \phi \pa{\nu} \phi = \Lambda g_{\mu\nu},
\end{equation*}
that can be written in the more conventional form
\begin{equation}
  R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \alpha \Big( \pa{\mu} \phi \pa{\nu} \phi - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} \big( \partial\phi \big)^2 \Big).
\end{equation}
Additionally, the second Bianchi identity imposes
%% \mbox{$\nabla^\mu \left( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R \right) = 0$,}
\begin{equation}
  \nabla^\mu \pa{\mu} \phi = 0.
\end{equation}
\hl{JZ: Esto muestra que la teoria contiene a R.G. com ocaso particular, pero tiene probablemente mucho mas. Que es lo extra?}
This condition is, in the sense argued in Ref.~\cite{Bekenstein:2014uwa}, the equation of motion for the scalar field. Notice that, the Euler--Lagrange equation of motion for the scalar field yields no information after taking the vanishing torsion ``truncation''.

It is well-known that this system of equations can be the obtained effectively from the Einstein--Hilbert action coupled minimally to a massless scalar field
\begin{equation}
  S_{\text{eff}} = \int \dn{4}{x} \sqrt{g} \Big( R + 2 \Lambda - \frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \pa{\mu}\phi \pa{\nu} \phi \Big).
\end{equation}

Summarising, we have shown that the  \emph{purely affine gravity} constructed in Ref.~\cite{Skirzewski:2014eta} possesses a well-defined torsionless limit, which generalizes the equations of motion  from GR. Moreover, our gravitational model coupled to a scalar field through the \emph{Eddington's metric} --- in the vanishing torsion consideration ---, is equivalent to GR minimally coupled to a massless scalar field. \hl{JZ: Ok, so?}
